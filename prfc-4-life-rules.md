**Background**

Holding PFRC for drafting some personal rules to live by. Because these things matter.

**Aims**

Establish a more sustainable, modern, and contentful way of life in line with [taopunk](https://taopunk.uk/taopunk) and solarpunk ideals.

**Spec**

Currently this section is organised by an extended version of the "Reduce, Re-use, Recycle" mantra. 

"Reject" has been added to remind myself not to jump into _stuff_ without thought.

"Extend" has been added to remind myself that maintenance and longevity are important. This may be rolled into "Re-use" later on.

### Reject

* Rejecting "ways of life" can be more important than working out how to live an unsustainable life better. Rejecting what is on offer to us is often the first and most fundamental shift in mindset we can take, whether it's small things or large abstract notions.

### Reduce

### Extend

* What do you have that has lasted 10 years? 20 years?
* _Nurture_ growth in things, in order to encourage longevity. This can apply to people, organisms, objects, places, communities, etc.

### Reuse

### Recycle

* The benefits of recycling are questioned and questionable, but surely better than regardless disposability. 

* Avoid throwing things into landfill.
